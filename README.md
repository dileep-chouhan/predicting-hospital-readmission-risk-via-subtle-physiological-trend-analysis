# Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk via Subtle Physiological Trend Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge.  The model leverages subtle trends and patterns within routinely collected physiological data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.  By identifying these at-risk patients, healthcare providers can allocate resources more effectively and potentially improve patient outcomes through proactive interventions. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).  Additionally, the script will generate visualization files (e.g., plots showing feature importance, ROC curves, or other relevant visualizations) in the `output` directory.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the analysis performed.  For example, you might see files such as `feature_importance.png` and `roc_curve.png`.
